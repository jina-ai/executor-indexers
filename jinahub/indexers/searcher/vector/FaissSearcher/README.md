# ✨ FaissSearcher

**FaissSearcher** is a Faiss-powered vector Searcher.

Faiss is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It contains algorithms that search in sets of vectors of any size, up to ones that possibly do not fit in RAM. It also contains supporting code for evaluation and parameter tuning. Faiss is written in C++ with complete wrappers for Python/numpy. Some of the most useful algorithms are implemented on the GPU. It is developed by Facebook AI Research.

## 🌱 Prerequisites

- This Executor works on Python 3.7 and 3.8. 
- Make sure to install the [requirements](./requirements.txt)

## 🚀 Usages

Check [tests](./tests) for an example on how to use it.

### Loading data

Since this is a "Searcher"-type Executor, it does not _index_ new data. Rather they are write-once classes, which take as data source a `dump_path`. 

This can be provided in different ways:

- in the YAML definition
  
```yaml
jtype: FaissSearcher
with:
    dump_path: /tmp/your_dump_location
...
```

- from the `Flow.rolling_update` method. See [README](../../../../../README.md).

The folder needs to contain the data exported from your Indexer. Again, see [README](../../../../../README.md).

### 🚚 Via JinaHub

#### using docker images
Use the prebuilt images from JinaHub in your python codes, 

```python
from jina import Flow
	
f = Flow().add(uses='jinahub+docker://FaissSearcher')
```

or in the `.yml` config.
	
```yaml
jtype: Flow
pods:
  - name: indexer
    uses: 'jinahub+docker://FaissSearcher'
```

#### using source codes
Use the source codes from JinaHub in your code

```python
from jina import Flow
	
f = Flow().add(uses='jinahub://FaissSearcher')
```

or in the `.yml` config.

```yaml
jtype: Flow
pods:
  - name: indexer
    uses: 'jinahub://FaissSearcher'
```


### 📦️ Via Pypi

1. Install the `executor-indexers` package.

	```bash
	pip install git+https://github.com/jina-ai/executor-indexers/
	```

1. Use `executor-indexers` in your code

	```python
	from jina import Flow
	from jinahub.indexers.searcher.vector.FaissSearcher import FaissSearcher
	
	f = Flow().add(uses=FaissSearcher)
	```


### 🐳 Via Docker

1. Clone the repo and build the docker image

	```shell
	git clone https://github.com/jina-ai/executor-indexers/
	cd jinahub/indexers/searcher/vector/FaissSearcher
	docker build -t faiss-image .
	```

1. Use `faiss-image` in your codes

	```python
	from jina import Flow
	
	f = Flow().add(uses='docker://faiss-image:latest')
	```
	

## 🎉️ Example 


```python
import numpy as np
from jina import Flow, Document

f = Flow().add(uses='jinahub+docker://FaissSearcher')

with f:
    resp = f.post(on='/search', inputs=Document(embedding=np.array([1,2,3])), return_results=True)
    print(f'{resp}')
```

### Inputs 

`Document` with `.embedding` the same shape as the `Documents` it has stored.

### Returns

Attaches matches to the Documents sent as inputs, with the id of the match, and its embedding. For retrieving the full metadata (original text or image blob), use a [key-value searcher](./../../keyvalue).
