# PostgreSQLIndexer

Indexer wrapper around the PostgreSQL DBMS. Postgres is an open source object-relational database. You can read more about it here: https://www.postgresql.org/

## NOTES

This indexer assumes a PRIMARY KEY on the `id` field, thus you cannot add two `Document` of the same id. Make sure you clean up any existing data if you want to start fresh. 

## USAGE

TBD
